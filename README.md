# Web App with Data Result

This is a minimal single-page web app that loads and displays the results generated by an automated Python script. The backend processing is defined in `execute.py` which is fixed and run in CI to produce `result.json`. The static webpage fetches `result.json` and displays it.

## Files

- `index.html`: The main webpage.
- `execute.py`: The Python script (fixed version). Provide here.
- `data.xlsx`: The original Excel data. Provide here.
- `data.csv`: Derived CSV version.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: GitHub Actions configuration.

## Setup

- Place `execute.py` and `data.xlsx` in the root directory.
- The conversion to CSV and execution are handled via CI.

## Automation

The GitHub Actions workflow runs `ruff`, executes the script, generates `result.json`, and publishes it via GitHub Pages.
